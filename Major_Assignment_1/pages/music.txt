                        <p>Music plays an integral and emotional role in our lives.  There was the song that was playing in the background during your first kiss.  The song you picked for your first dance at your wedding.  The song that helped you through a difficult time.  Or the song you and your friends belted out at the top of your lungs one summer night around a campfire.

We all have stories and memories tied to songs that have become a part of who are, because music plays an integral part of shaping our identity as we mature through life.</p><p>The best music will be played as per your choice and as per the theme</p>
